374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

    def guessNumber(self, n):

            mid = left + (right - left)//2
            if guess(mid) == -1:
                right = mid
            elif guess(mid) == 1:
                left = mid
            elif guess(mid) == 0:
                return mid
            
        if guess(left) == 0:
            return left
        if guess(right) == 0:
            return right
